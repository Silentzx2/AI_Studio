# AI 3D Studio — Changelog

## v3.2.0 — uv-Only Package Management (January 25, 2026)

### Breaking Changes

- **Central install policy removed**: All install endpoints now require an explicit model list via `resolve_install_targets()` in `installer.py`. Passing `models=None` to install everything is no longer supported.
- **Weights directory moved**: Model weights are now stored in `third_party/<RepoName>/weights/` instead of the centralized `third_party/weights/<provider_name>/`. Run `./scripts/update-models.sh --migrate` to migrate existing weights.

### New Features

- **Per-model isolated environments**: Each model gets its own `.venv/` under `third_party/<RepoName>/.venv/`, created via `uv venv` (uv is a hard dependency — no fallback to pip/venv).
- **StorageConfig per-model methods**: `get_model_venv_path()`, `get_model_venv_python()`, `get_model_weights_dir()`.
- **Weight resolution with fallback**: `get_weight_path()` checks per-model location first, then falls back to old centralized path.
- **Migration script**: `backend/scripts/migrate_weights_to_per_model.py` with copy-then-verify strategy, accessible via `./scripts/update-models.sh --migrate`.
- **Install concurrency control**: File-based locks at `third_party/<repo_name>/.installing.lock` prevent parallel installs of the same model.
- **Pre-download disk space check**: Disk space is verified before starting weight downloads.

### Docker Changes

- **Bind mounts replace named volumes**: `model_storage` and `third_party_storage` named volumes replaced with `./backend/storage:/app/storage` and `./backend/third_party:/app/third_party`.
- **New `backend/.dockerignore`**: Excludes `third_party/`, `storage/`, `.runtime_cache/` from build context. Root `.dockerignore` also updated.
- **BuildKit cache mount**: Dockerfile now uses `--mount=type=cache,target=/root/.cache/pip` for faster rebuilds.
- **`uv` installed in image**: Required for per-model venv creation.

### Files Changed

- `backend/runtime/installer.py` — `resolve_install_targets()`, per-model venv creation
- `backend/runtime/storage.py` — `get_model_venv_path()`, `get_model_venv_python()`, `get_model_weights_dir()`, updated `get_weight_path()`
- `backend/scripts/migrate_weights_to_per_model.py` — new migration script
- `backend/Dockerfile` — BuildKit cache, `uv` install
- `backend/.dockerignore` — new file
- `docker-compose.yml` — bind mounts
- `.dockerignore` — root-level exclusions
- `AGENTS.md` — new "Model Pipeline Structure Rules (post-restructure)" section

## Frontend Rendering Fix - Changelog

## Issue Summary
Frontend components failed to render due to duplicate "use client" directives, blocking all page navigation and preventing API calls from being made.

## Root Cause
Invalid JavaScript syntax in 48 files:
```tsx
"use client";      // Valid
'use client';      // INVALID - second directive causes parser error
```

## Impact
- ❌ Workspace page wouldn't open
- ❌ Settings page wouldn't open  
- ❌ Admin redirects failed
- ❌ No API calls were made (rendering failed before fetch)
- ❌ "Backend Offline" message displayed (misleading - backend was fine)
- ❌ "GPU Unavailable" not detected (rendering failed before health check)

## Fix Applied
Removed all 48 duplicate single-quoted 'use client' directives from:
- 4 app routes
- 15 admin tab/dashboard files
- 13 workspace component files
- 4 settings section files
- 2 landing feature files
- 18 UI/motion/image-gen components
- 3 hook files

## Additional Improvements
1. Fixed admin page redirect router logic with proper timer handling
2. Added localStorage safety checks (typeof window guards)
3. Added comprehensive FIXES_APPLIED.md documentation

## Testing Checklist
- [x] Build completes without errors
- [x] All files parse correctly (no syntax errors)
- [x] Navigation works: home → workspace → settings → admin
- [x] Workspace page renders
- [x] Settings sections render
- [x] Admin redirect to settings works
- [x] No hydration errors
- [x] No console errors
- [x] Backend status calls complete
- [x] GPU status indicator works

## Deployment
1. Replace modified files in your frontend directory
2. Run: `npm run build`
3. Verify: `npm start`
4. Test navigation flow
5. No backend changes needed

## Files Modified: 52 Total
See FIXES_APPLIED.md for detailed breakdown.

## Before vs After
### Before
```
Frontend: ❌ All pages fail to render
Navigation: ❌ Completely blocked
API Calls: ❌ Never made (rendering fails first)
User Experience: ❌ "Something crashed" error
```

### After  
```
Frontend: ✅ All pages render correctly
Navigation: ✅ Full navigation flow works
API Calls: ✅ Complete successfully
User Experience: ✅ Full functionality restored
```
